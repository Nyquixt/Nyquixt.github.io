title: "Paradox of AlphaZero: Strategic vs. Optimal Plays"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2020-ipccc
excerpt: "<b>Abstract.</b> This article analyzes AlphaZero-type algorithms quantitatively from the viewpoint of local and global optimal sequences of play on a 7×7 board. Through targeted evaluation of the AI agent, the authors reveal the strategic, that is, winrate-dominated, nature of such algorithms, and expose thereby certain inherent obstacles against optimal play. Possible remedies are then explored, leading to techniques that may help further quantitative analysis of those algorithms and for the search for optimal solutions, on 7×7 as well as larger boards."
